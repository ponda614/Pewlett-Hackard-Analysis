# Overview of the Analysis

Bobby’s manager has given me two more assignments: determine the number of retiring employees per title, and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. Then, you’ll write a report that summarizes your analysis and helps prepare Bobby’s manager for the “silver tsunami” as many current employees reach retirement age.

# Results

1.	There are 90,398 employees who are likely to retire soon.

2.	Only 2 managers need to be replaced after they retire.

3.	29,414 retiring are Senior Engineers 

4.	28,254 retiring are senior staff

5.	14,222 retiring are engineers

6.	12,243 retiring are staff

7.	4,502 retiring are technique leaders

9.	And 2 retiring are managers

## Mentorship Eligibility:

1.	1,549 staff members are eligible for a mentorship opportunity.

2.	569 senior staff members are eligible for mentorship.

3.	169 senior engineers are eligible for mentorship.

4.	77 technique leaders are eligible for mentorship.

5.	501 engineers are eligible for mentorship.

6.	155 staff members are eligible for mentorship.

# Summary:

Looking at the analyses, we can see that of the 90,398 potential spaces that need to be filled due to retirement, there are only 1,549 employees currently eligible to mentor new employees to fill those positions. This means there is one mentor for every 58 new employees. This means there will be a potential issue for mentoring the new employees because there will not be enough employees to mentor the next generation.
